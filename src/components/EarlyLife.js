        Abdul Kalam was born in a poor but ambitious family in Rameswaram,
        Tamil Nadu, India. He was an average student but worked hard to
        improve his grades and pursued a degree in physics and aerospace
        engineering. He graduated from the Madras Institute of Technology
        in 1955 and joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of
        the Defense Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) as a
        scientist. He worked as a scientist at DRDO and ISRO and was known
        for his contributions to science and technology. He was awarded the
        Bharat Ratna and served as the President of India from 2002 to
        2007. Kalam was committed to education and believed that it was
        the key to unlocking India's potential. He was widely respected and
        admired for his humility, integrity, and dedication to public
